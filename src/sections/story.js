It takes a median of about 90 days to get paid, which means contractors are often stuck without enough working capital. This is a nightmare for contractors who need cash flow in order to continue working on projects.','UdyogPay changes this with its early payment system for contractors.','We not only handle invoices for contractors but also digitize the paper-based billing into a fast and efficent way to release payment to the contractorsâ€™ bank accounts in just a few clicks. With our partner banks and our proprietary technology, we make sure the payment reaches your contractors not in days but minutes.']
